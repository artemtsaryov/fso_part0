note over browser:
User fills in the text input (note) and hits submit button
end note

note over browser:
Browser calls the event handler of form submit, which updates the note list on the page via DOM API and sends the new note to the server
Although, I'd rather started with sending a note to the server to make sure it completes the operation and then rendered the note on the page to avoid potential inconsistency caused by server or network error
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
note over server:
Server saves the note from POST request body
end note
server-->browser: HTTP 201 Created

note over browser:
Browser requests default icon
end note
browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/favicon.ico
server-->browser: HTML code (looks a bit odd...)
